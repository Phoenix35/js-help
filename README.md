# Get started with JavaScript

**The language of the Web**

<p class="notice">Note: I assume you have some prior knowledge on command line and know how to use google and documentations for simple things.</p>

A good environment fosters learning, so we are going to set one up. This will be all you need to properly code.

## Browser

Use an evergreen browser: [Mozilla Firefox](<https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/all/>) or [Google Chrome](<https://www.google.com/chrome/>).

## Documentation

Install [DevDocs desktop](<https://devdocs.egoist.moe/>) (by Egoist).  
In "Preferences", enable following documentation
  - CSS
  - DOM
  - DOM Events
  - ESLint
  - Git
  - HTML
  - HTTP
  - JavaScript
  - Node.js
  - npm
  - Support tables

In "Offline Data", make sure to install all the documentation you enabled. It will be around 100 MB of data.  
This will be your go-to reference, make sure to create an easily accessible shortcut to use it!

This program is the desktop version of [DevDocs](<https://devdocs.io/>).  
There is no need anymore to search through MDN, the node.js API, or kangax table/caniuse for example. This collects it all and delivers it in one place in a consistent formatting.

## Node.js

If not already done, install [Node.js](<https://nodejs.org/en/download/>). I prefer the latest version but you can install LTS if you want (v10 "Dubnium" as of writing).  
You should spend some time learning how to use node.js and particularly npm after you've become familiar with JavaScript proper.

## Editor

If not already done, install a text editor / IDE **suited for web development**
  - Free text editor: [VS Code](<https://code.visualstudio.com/>) or [VS Codium](<https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium#vscodium>) for the ones that don't like telemetry
  - "Winrar free" text editor: [Sublime Text](<https://www.sublimetext.com/>)
  - Paid IDE: [Webstorm](<https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/>) (PyCharm Pro edition also includes WebStorm)

## ESLint

**The** linter.  
Install the [ESLint](<https://eslint.org/>) package globally. Configure your editor to use it. VS Code for example has a marketplace extension to simplify the process.

Use [this](<{{ "/resources/node.eslintrc.yml" | relative-url }}>) (_Work in Progress_) ESLint configuration for node projects and [this](<>) (_Work in Progress_) one for browser projects.  
This programming style takes precedence over whatever practice is shown in the next resources.

## Closing remarks

You are set to start learning JS. You can now go to {{ "/resources/" | relative-url }}

Once you've finished both tutorials, you can follow on [good practices](<https://gist.github.com/Phoenix35/a80ee9a63c39b581dd8f674108fe5736/>).  
You may notice you already apply a lot of them simply because you followed the aforementioned tutorials and the ESLint configuration that was given.

**Congratulations**! You now have a solid programming basis on which you can start to build your projects. Have fun :)
