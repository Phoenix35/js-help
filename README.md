<p class="notice">Note: I assume you have some prior knowledge on command line and know how to use Google and documentations for simple things.</p>

A good environment fosters learning, so we are going to set one up. This will be all you need to properly code.

## Browser

Use an evergreen browser: [Mozilla Firefox](<https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/all/>) or [Google Chrome](<https://www.google.com/chrome/>).

## Documentation

<p class="notice">DevDocs has not updated its JS info since 2018.</p>

Install [DevDocs desktop](<https://devdocs.egoist.moe/>) (by Egoist).  
In "Preferences", enable following documentation
  - CSS
  - DOM
  - DOM Events
  - ESLint
  - Git
  - HTML
  - HTTP
  - JavaScript
  - Node.js
  - npm
  - Support tables

In "Offline Data", make sure to install all the documentation you enabled. It will be around 100 MB of data.  
This will be your go-to reference, make sure to create an easily accessible shortcut to use it!

This program is the desktop version of [DevDocs](<https://devdocs.io/>).  
There is no need anymore to search through MDN, the node.js API, or kangax table/caniuse for example. This collects it all and delivers it in one place in a consistent formatting.

Developers using Apple products may be interested in [Dash](<https://kapeli.com/dash>) as a powerful alternative.

## Node.js

If not already done, install [Node.js](<https://nodejs.org/en/download/>). I prefer the latest version but you can install LTS if you want (v12 "Erbium" as of writing).  
You should spend some time learning how to use node.js and particularly npm after you've become familiar with JavaScript proper.

## Editor

If not already done, install a text editor / IDE **suited for web development**
  - Free text editor: [VS Code](<https://code.visualstudio.com/>) or [VS Codium](<https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium#vscodium>) for the ones that don't like telemetry
  - "Winrar free" text editor: [Sublime Text](<https://www.sublimetext.com/>)
  - Paid IDE: [Webstorm](<https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/>) (PyCharm Pro edition also includes WebStorm)

## ESLint

Follow [this link](<https://github.com/Phoenix35/eslint-config>).

## Closing remarks

**Congratulations**! You are now set to start learning JS in a good environment for your projects.  
Your next step is to go to the [resources](<{{ "./resources/" | relative-url }}>) section. Have fun ☺️
