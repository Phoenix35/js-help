title: Strict mode
position: 001

**This is not arguable**! Code in [strict mode](<https://eslint.org/docs/rules/strict>), ALWAYS!

This MUST appear at the top of every file that is not an [ES6 module](<http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_modules.html#sec_overview-modules>).
```js
"use strict";
```
ECMAScript Modules are already in strict mode so there is no need for this directive.
