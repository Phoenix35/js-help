title: Angular, React, Vue.js, others?

As a hobby? My first choice would be [Vue.js](<https://vuejs.org/>). Otherwise [React](<https://reactjs.org/>).

To learn the trade for future jobs? It depends entirely on your market. If you don't know, I would go for React this time , as it's the least opinionated.  
But look the stack used by companies in the area you want to apply, this will be a far better gauge.
