[React](<https://reactjs.org/>). Don't learn Angular if you don't have to.  
Until React [Suspense](<https://reactjs.org/docs/concurrent-mode-intro.html>) is a thing, use [React Async](<https://docs.react-async.com/>).

To learn the trade for future jobs? It depends entirely on your market. If you don't know, I would go for React this time, as it's the least opinionated.  
But look the stack used by companies in the area you want to apply, this will be a far better gauge.
