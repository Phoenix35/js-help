[React](<https://reactjs.org/>). Don't learn Angular if you don't have to.

To learn the trade for future jobs? It depends entirely on your market. If you don't know, I would go for React this time, as it's the least opinionated.  
But look the stack used by companies in the area you want to apply, this will be a far better gauge.
