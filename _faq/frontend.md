Make sure you are at least intermediate in JavaScript (see [Resources](<{{ "/resources/" | absolute_url }}>)). Learn some [HTML](<https://htmldog.com/guides/html/>)/[CSS](<https://htmldog.com/guides/css/>).

Expand your skills with [network, SEO, accessibility, APIs, etc...](<https://frontendmasters.com/books/front-end-handbook/2019/>).
