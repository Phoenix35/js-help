Make sure you are at least intermediate in JavaScript (see [Resources](<{{ "/resources/" | absolute_url }}>)). Learn some [HTML](<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML>)/[CSS](<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS>).

Expand your skills with [network, SEO, accessibility, APIs, etc...](<https://frontendmasters.com/books/front-end-handbook/2019/>).
