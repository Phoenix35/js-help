If you are just beginning in JS, only some parts of [The Modern JavaScript tutorial](<https://javascript.info/>) are required:
- The whole of [Part 1](<https://javascript.info/js>)
- (Part 3: Network requests) [Fetch basics](<https://javascript.info/fetch-basics>), [the URL object](<https://javascript.info/url>)
- (Part 3) [Regular Expressions](<https://javascript.info/regular-expressions>)
As well as 2 [primers](<https://nodejs.dev/learn/the-nodejs-event-emitter>) on [events](<https://nodejs.dev/learn/the-nodejs-events-module>), and [Websocket](<https://javascript.info/websocket>)

Why fetch if you're going to use node.js? Because if you want to make requests to remote URLs, you will be using [node-fetch](<https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch>).

Now you're ready to learn using [the only valid discord.js bot tutorial](<https://discordjs.guide/>), you're welcome.
