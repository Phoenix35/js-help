## Everyone

## Beginners

- [The Modern Javascript Tutorial](<https://javascript.info/>)
- [Eloquent Javascript (online)](<https://eloquentjavascript.net/>); 3rd edition now available as [paperback](<http://a-fwd.com/com=marijhaver-20&asin-com=1593279507>) too!
- **Only if you have a really good programming knowledge background** [JavaScript for impatient programmers](<http://exploringjs.com/impatient-js/index.html>)

Nothing more. Nothing less.

## Intermediate

At this level you HAVE to know how to use callbacks and promises.

Work in progress (WIP)
- If you have ES5.1 knowledge and want to be up-to-date [Exploring ES6](<http://exploringjs.com/es6.html>) + [Exploring ES2016 and 2017](<http://exploringjs.com/es2016-es2017.html>) + [Exploring ES2018 and ES2019](<http://exploringjs.com/es2018-es2019/index.html>)

## Advanced

Work in progress (WIP)

- [You don't know JS](<https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/>)  
"but wait I heard it's a good book for beginners?" Only if you know what is in ES6+ and what is not, so that you can discard outdated content and advice. That's why I put it in advanced.
- Advances on the [TC39 proposals](<https://prop-tc39.now.sh/>)

## Expert
